# [CRISKLE](https://app.secureelements.io/login)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

At some places we are using newly promoted Functional-based React.js components which uses concepts of hooks including `useEffect`, `useState`, `useCallback` â€” please refer https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html for more.

At most of the place where _more of stateful, more of data-based UI_ is required we chose to use Class-based React.js components. There is nothing like _that classical render() & componentDidMount() function._
