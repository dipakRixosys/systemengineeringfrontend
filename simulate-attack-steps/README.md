## Pre-simulate Attack Steps

This project is live-hosted at https://api.cybergenics.co.uk/simulate-attack-steps/index.html. Made using older version of `React.js`. Uses D3.js for drawing, parses attack tree and draw it on canvas.

### Inspired by Electron-based React.js app

#### Updates 
- One can use packages `create-react-class` & `prop-types` for update purpose as React.js deprecated Custom-Class & Custom-Props in after versions. Best to not touch code â€” if it's working, it's working.
